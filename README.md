# React + Vite + Tauri

Tetris is a classic arcade game where the player controls falling
tetrominoes (geometric shapes) made up of four square blocks. The
objective of the game is to fill horizontal lines on the game field
without leaving any empty spaces. When a line is completely filled,
it disappears, and the player earns points. The controls are as
follows: the arrow keys left and right move the tetromino, the down
arrow speeds up its fall, the spacebar rotates the shape, and the up
arrow pauses the game.

This Tetris game was created by a passionate developer interested in
web development and game design. It is built using JavaScript,
React, HTML, and CSS to create an interactive and responsive user
interface. Tauri was used to package the game, allowing it to be
compiled into a native Windows executable, in addition to being
deployable as a web application. This makes the game versatile, as
it can be accessed through a browser or run offline as a standalone
app.
